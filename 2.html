   is <strong><u>a style sheet language</u></strong> used for describing the presentation
   of a document written in a markup language like HTML.<br> CSS is a cornerstone
   technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
   CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,<br> including
   layout,colors, and fonts.
   This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
   control in the specification of presentation characteristics,<br> enable multiple
   web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.
   css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

   <p style="margin-top:30px">
   Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
   page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
   by voice <br>(via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
   CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<br>
   The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style
   rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority
   scheme is predictable.
