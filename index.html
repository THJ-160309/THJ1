   <h2>WEB</h2>
   <p>The World Wide Web (WWW or WEB), commonly known as the Web, <br>is an information system
   where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators<br>
   (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
   and are accessible over the Internet.<br> The resources of the WWW may be accessed
   by users by a software application called a web browser.</p>
   <p>English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.<br>
   He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
   The browser was released outside CERN in 1991,<br> first to other research institutions
   starting in January 1991 and then to the general public in August 1991.<br>
   The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age
   and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
